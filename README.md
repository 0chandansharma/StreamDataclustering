Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters in Stream data using Real Time Fuzzy c means .

Clustering is the challenge in data mining, especially when we are dealing with massive 
continuous data such as stream data, it requires both correct clustering of data and 
accurate determination of the number of clusters. To ﬁnd the optimal number of cluster 
for stream data has obtaining a sensible result in clustering analysis. However, there 
is no any generalization of pre-knowledge about the appropriate number of the clusters 
in many clustering algorithms such as Kmeans, k-means++ and fuzzy c-means by which we 
check whether the result of clustering is either appropriate or not. We propose a novel
algorithm, real time fuzzy c-means for stream data to determine the optimal number of 
clusters and optimize it by genetic algorithm to ﬁnd optimal solution. The most appropriate
number of clusters is determined by using cluster validation indices in the available fuzzy 
clustering literature. We analyze the complexity of the data by using combination of compactness
and separation to validate the clusters. We compare various validation indices and our results
get more closer to optimal for both small as well as large data.
